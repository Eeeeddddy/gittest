PLUGIN BUGS

* "Project Sources" dialog: When I first press "Project Sources", user
  presented with an empty window and no classes, and no indication of
  what user is to do. Should show a list of classes for the selected
  project, or something like that. Also, the Project Sources class
  selection dialog changes behavior on subsequent presses: it seems to
  remember which classes I searched for in earlier dialogs, and shows
  those classes in subsequent dialogs, which is confusing.

* Stop button is not greyed out when stop is pressed in the console

* As I use the plugin in an example use, many errors show up in the
  Error Log window of the test Eclipse application.

* Run config, parameters tab: Thread Timeout, Null Ratio not working,
  I couldn't get Randoop to run without threads, and when changing the
  values for these fields, the "Apply" button stays greyed out.

* Sometimes, pressing the "Regenerate tests" button results in NPE on
  MessageViewListener.

* When invoking Randoop, it and other plugin jars should come after
  user classes in classpath, otherwise Randoop-specific classes
  (e.g. graph.Node in randoop.jar) can shadow user classes. The real
  solution here is actually to rename all randoop classes more
  uniquely, to avoid clashes.

* [Feature request, after beta release] Refresh generated directories
  in package explorer upon completion of generation.

* [Feature request, after beta release] Add buttom to remove all
  Randoop-generate files.
