PLUGIN BUGS / FEATURE REQUESTS

* [Improvment request, not showstopper bug] Launch configuration (both
  wizard and config tab): please do a bit of visual rearrangement of
  the configuration a bit to make more user-friendly, as follows (the
  "[...]" symbol means the place where user inputs text; test in
  between *pound symbols* means bolded or italicized):

 1. First should come stopping criteria, as follows:

   -----------------------------------------------------
   *Stopping criterion.* Stop test generation after:

     Randoop has generated [...] tests, OR
     Randoop has generates tests for [...] seconds
   -----------------------------------------------------

 2. Second should come output prameters, as follows:

   -----------------------------------------------------
   *Test output parameters.*
   
   Output tests that: [Fail/Pass/All selection]
   -----------------------------------------------------

  3. Finally, all the others. Title this section "Advanced" so that
     user knows they don't have to touch them on first pass; anslo,
     delete the "Maximum Tests Written" dialog for now; let's have
     current behavior be all tests output.


* Randoop generated JUnit files appeared to be uncompilable when
  class-input was used from the default package
  
* Sometimes the project does a full build when opening the launch
  dialog. This is very time-consuming.

* If you edit some code: remove, change visibility, or change parameters
  to some method that are used in a launch configuration, when you click
  on that launch configuration there will be unsaved changes.
  REASON: The config stores methods so it knows what should be checked
          when the config is opened, but it checks if the methods are
          available before adding them to the list.
  SOLUTION: Probably the best way to fix this would be to have a refresh
            button that searches for changes, removes methods that don't
            exist, and adds new ones that have been added.
            
* Cannot run tests on methods with generic type parameters without testing
  the entire class.

* "Project Sources" dialog: When I first press "Project Sources", user
  presented with an empty window and no classes, and no indication of
  what user is to do. Should show a list of classes for the selected
  project, or something like that. Also, the Project Sources class
  selection dialog changes behavior on subsequent presses: it seems to
  remember which classes I searched for in earlier dialogs, and shows
  those classes in subsequent dialogs, which is confusing.

* As I use the plugin in an example use, many errors show up in the
  Error Log window of the test Eclipse application.

* Sometimes, pressing the "Regenerate tests" button results in NPE on
  MessageViewListener.

* [Feature request, after beta release] Refresh generated directories
  in package explorer upon completion of generation.

* [Feature request, after beta release] Add buttom to remove all
  Randoop-generate files.
  
* [Feature request, after beta release] Delete button should be able
  to remove selected classes from the class selector

* Randoop view: Stop button stays red even after Randoop has terminated.
